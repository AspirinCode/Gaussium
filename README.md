# Quantum Chemistry
A basic quantum chemical program written in python using the numpy library.

I intend to write the Hartree-Fock method in python and then perhaps move onto more complex theories such as CCSD, CI and DFT. After this project is complete I might move onto another language such as Fortran, C or C++ and then one of the more exotic languages such as Haskell.

I'm basing this work on Attlia Szabo and Neil S. Ostlunds "Modern Quantum Chemistry: Introduction to Advanced Electronic Structure Theory". It is a old but well written book and is by far the best introduction to the Hartree-Fock method I have read.
