##Introduction
A basic quantum chemical program written in python using the numpy and scipy libraries.

Currently this program fully supports RHF, UHF, CIS, TDHF and MP2, next plans are to reduce ERI time by taking advantage of molecule symmetry and then to implement more correlated methods such as DFT and CI. 

I'm basing this work on Attlia Szabo and Neil S. Ostlunds "Modern Quantum Chemistry: Introduction to Advanced Electronic Structure Theory" and David B. Cooks "Handbook of Computational Chemistry".
