# Quantum Chemistry
A basic quantum chemical program written in python using the numpy library and is only at its very beginnings. My time is tight as I try to balance this between my job and real-life so development may go slowly.

Currently I'm looking to write HF in python and then to more accurate methods such as CI, CCSD and DFT. After this project is complete I may try out other languages such as Fortran, C, C++, Java, C# or even Haskell if I have the time.

I'm basing this work on Attlia Szabo and Neil S. Ostlunds "Modern Quantum Chemistry: Introduction to Advanced Electronic Structure Theory". It is a old but well written book, and is by far the best introduction to the computational chemistry I have read. The only other textbook that comes close to this is probably Robert G. Parr and Weitao Yangs "Density Functional Theory of Atoms and Molecules". After this I intend to check out David B. Cooks "Handbook of Computational Chemistry" which appears to be quite in depth.
